Those are my University projects from Computer Architecture Operation System classes. (1st year)

C project was intended to teach us how to not cause memory leaks, work with pointers, implement DFS and other stuff.

In these classes we also learned fundamentals of assembly language (2 projects) to take our understanding of programming on a deeper level
